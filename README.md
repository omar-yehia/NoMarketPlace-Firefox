# No-Marketplace
(Firefox Add-on)

2019 Omar Yehia

Remove Marketplace from Facebook Homepage.
Facebook homepage has many sections on the side,
one of them is the marketplace section,
which sometimes displays repetitive and annoying suggestions.
The solution was this add-on that enables you to hide/show those sections as you want.
